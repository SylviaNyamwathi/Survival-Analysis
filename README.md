# Survival Analysis of Cancer Patients

## Project Overview
This project involves performing a **survival analysis** on cancer patients to assess the effectiveness of various chemotherapy treatments. The goal is to identify which chemotherapy regimen results in the highest survival rate among patients.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze the survival times of cancer patients who underwent different chemotherapy treatments.
- Compare the survival probabilities across treatment groups.
- Identify the chemotherapy regimen associated with the highest survival rates.
- Provide data-driven insights to inform treatment decisions.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, and other personal attributes.
- **Treatment Information**: Type of chemotherapy received, dosage, and treatment duration.
- **Survival Data**: Time from treatment initiation to either the end of follow-up or patient death.
- **Outcome**: Whether the patient survived (yes/no).

## Methodology
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**: Used to estimate survival functions for each chemotherapy group.
- **Log-Rank Test**: Employed to compare survival curves across different treatments.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Applied to adjust for potential confounding factors such as age and disease stage.

## Tools - SPSS

## Results
The analysis revealed that chemotherapy regimen X demonstrated the highest survival rate, outperforming other treatments by a statistically significant margin.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of survival analysis to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different cancer treatments, enabling data-driven decisions in healthcare.
